# Selex_Mall
The Selex mall system is a web-based micro management system designed to manage shops and employees in a mall setting
The administrator can add,view,update,and delete shops and employees using system’s user-friendly admin interface.It uses a client-server architecture in which REST API calls are used to connect the frontend and backend.
HTML,CSS,and Javascript are used to create the interface,Node.js (Express) is used to develop the backend.All of the data is stored in a JSON file,which enables the system to function without an external database.Railway,which offers simple hosting and automatic builds, is used to deploy the full application.

code reference :
